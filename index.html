    <h4> Horsens - Jættstuen Grønhøj in Byghom Skov </h4>
    <br> <br>

    <p>
      Denmark is dotted with Jættstue, ancient mounds built for burials and ceremonies.
    </p>

    <p> The Jættestue in Byghom Skov is known to the locals, I would never have seen this if not for Jørgen.  The word Jætte means 'giant', which would mean it would be a tight squeeze through the 3-foot high entrance to the burial chamber.  The Jætte were active 5,000 years BC to 3,000 years BC, and gained mythic power and stature during Viking times.  Through Norse mythology, the Vikings related them to wild nature and natural forces, such as snow, cold and fire. Their home world was called Jotunheim, and was one of the nine worlds of Nordic cosmology. They were considered feisty opponents of the gods, but these giants were not actually evil, but rather representative of wild and untamed nature. Their spirit was both life-giving and destructive in nature; they could both help and harm people and gods. By appearance they could be completely incredibly <a href="./resources/images/jaette_woman_1600a.jpg" target="_blank">beautiful</a> or hideous and  <a href="./resources/images/jaette_man_375.jpg" target="_blank">repulsive</a>.

    <h4> Jelling - ancestral home of the Viking kings </h4>
    <br> <br>

    <p>
      Jelling is an important site in Danish history, the sacred site of the earliest Danish kings.  The oldest rune stone by Gørn contains the first reference to 'Denmark'.  Gørn's son became King Harold Bluetooth, who introduced Christianity to the Danes.  Parts of the Viking culture persisted, but Thor's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir"   target="_blank">Hammer</a> gave way to the Cross.  Harold Bluetooth's runic initials became the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-origin" target="_blank"> logo</a> for the Bluetooth wireless company.  The <a href="http://en.natmus.dk/museums/kongernes-jelling-home-of-the-viking-kings/" target="_blank">Jelling_museum</a> boasts a high-tech multi-media re-creation of what Danish life was like in Viking times.

      On the patio, we had interesting conversations about the origins of alternative therapies.  Jørgen is a practioner of EFT, a method that borrows from acupuncture and acupressure by tapping specific areas of the body in a specific sequence to bring about the release of emotional and physical pain points.  The technique is also used by sports figures for pain management and increased focus.  Later, we watched EFT founder Gary Craig <a href="https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-mozilla-003&hsimp=yhs-003&hspart=mozilla&p=eft+video+demonstration+craig#id=4&vid=36573f5c6b419a2adc63e376257bbdf6&action=view" target="_blank">explain</a> the system, and also watched as he performed a smoking cessation <a href="https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-mozilla-003&hsimp=yhs-003&hspart=mozilla&p=eft+video+demonstration+craig#id=2&vid=97a22beffb62668b21bc08ad0693ba30&action=view" target="_blank">session</a> to great effect.  A complete demo and description of the tapping technique and the location of the body's meridians can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wG2FA4vfLQ" target="_blank"> here</a>.
